Module "AC1"       (component AnalogComp_LDD)
   - AC1_Init -Initializes the device according to design-time configuration properties. Allocates memory for the device data 
                structure.  If the <Enable in init. code> is set to "yes" then the device is also enabled and some time is 
                required before stabilizing of the comparator output. If the <Interrupt service/event> property is enabled, it 
                is recommended to enable events after comparator output stabilizes to prevent an unwanted event invocation 
                before output stabilization.

Module "DA1"       (component DAC_LDD)
   - DA1_Init -Initializes the device according to design-time configuration properties. Allocates memory for the device data 
                structure.   If the <Enable in init. code> is set to "yes" then the device is also enabled (see the description 
                of the Enable method).  This method can be called only once. Before the second call of Init the Deinit method 
                must be called first. If DMA service is enabled this method also initializes inherited DMA Transfer component.
   - DA1_SetValue -Sets DAC output voltage according to specified value.  Input data format is specified by <Data mode> 
                property settings. If selected formatting is not native for DAC device which is used then any necessary 
                transformations (e.g. shifting) are done._/Note: This method is available only if Data buffer is disabled./_

Module "Cpu"       (component MKE02Z64QH2)
